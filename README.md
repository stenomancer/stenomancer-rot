This is the stenomancer project a roguelike meant to teach you the basics
of stenography by collecting the keys. This will get you used to the keyboard
layout. You can use the directional buttons or combo some keys like you would
with stenography to move around and collect the keys for your steno keyboard.

This project uses the rot.js framework.
